    "text": "Why Choose Google Cloud?\nGoogle Cloud Platform is an excellent choice for deploying R projects due to its scalability, compatibility with R tools, and a wide range of services. While other cloud providers like AWS and Azure are equally viable, we focus on GCP because it’s what we’re most comfortable with. Other cloud service providers are as recommended as GCP, and most of the services and procedures remain similar.\nWe recommend creating a new account for each project. First, to keep projects encapsulated in their own account, making it easier to manage and organize resources. Second, because Google offers $300 in credits for every new account, providing a great opportunity to experiment with their services at no cost."

Don’t worry—your payment method won’t be charged until your $300 free credits are either spent or expire in 90 days. Let’s get started!\n\nVisit https://cloud.google.com/.\nClick the “Start Free” button.\n\n\n\nClick “Create account”, then choose “For work or my business” (or another option that suits your needs).\n\n\n\nClick “Get a Gmail address”.\n\n\n\nEnter your First and Last names, and then click on “Next”.\n\n\n\nFill in your birthdate and Gender, and click on “Next”.\n\n\n\nClick “Get a Gmail address instead”.\n\n\n\nFill in your Username (we recommend a name related to the new project), and click “Next”.\n\n\n\nFill in your Password, and click “Next”.\n\n\n\nFill in your Phone number, and click “Next”. This step is safe; you won’t be charged anything to your phone number, and you can use your number for as many accounts as you need.\n\n\n\nEnter the verification code you receive via SMS, and click “Next”.\n\n\n\nAdd a Recovery email (we recommend using your most used email), and click “Next”.\n\n\n\nFill in your Phone number again, and click “Next”.\n\n\n\nIf a screen pops up stating that your phone number is already in use for another account, click “Continue creating a new account”.\n\n\n\nJust click “Skip”.\n\n\n\nClick “Next”.\n\n\n\nThoroughly read the terms and conditions, and click “I agree” (if you agree).\n\n\n\nClick “Not Now”.\n\n\n\nFill in your business country, and click “Agree & continue” (if you agree with the terms).\n\n\n\nClick “Start free”.\n\n\n\nFill in your payments profile. Here, we use the “Individual” profile type.\n\n\n\nClick “Start free”.\n\n\n\nFill in your payment method details. Here, we’ve used a credit card.\n\n\n\nAdd your credit card information. It won’t be charged until your free credits expire, at which point you can decide whether to continue paying or disable non-free-tier services.\n\n\n\nClick “Start free”.\n\n\n\nClick “Done”.\n\n\n\nThat’s it! Your account is now ready to use, with free-tier services enabled, and you’ve got $300 in credits to use within the next 3 months."
