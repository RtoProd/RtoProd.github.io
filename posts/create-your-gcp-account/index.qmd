## Welcome to RtoProd.com!

Welcome to the first blog post on **RtoProd.com**! Our mission is to provide tips, tricks, and insights to help you transition your R code to production-grade infrastructure. 

Before diving into the technical aspects of deploying R applications, the very first thing we need is an account on a production-grade infrastructure platform. In this post, we'll guide you through creating a **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** account. GCP offers a robust and scalable environment perfect for hosting R applications, pipelines, and APIs. By following this tutorial, you'll set up your account and gain access to [$300 in free credits](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-trial){.external target="_blank"}.

In addition to the free credits, GCP offers a range of free-tier services that you can use indefinitely under specified limits. You can find a complete list of [free-tier services here](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-tier-usage-limits){.external target="_blank"}.

## Why Choose Google Cloud?

Google Cloud Platform is an excellent choice for deploying R projects due to its scalability, compatibility with R tools, and a wide range of services. While other cloud providers like AWS and Azure are equally viable, we focus on GCP because it's what we're most comfortable with. Other cloud service providers are as recommended as GCP, and most of the services and procedures remain similar.

We recommend creating a new account for each project. First, to keep projects encapsulated in their own account, making it easier to manage and organize resources. Second, because Google offers $300 in credits for every new account, providing a great opportunity to experiment with their services at no cost.

## Creating Your First Project (Optional)

While it's perfectly fine to start with the default "My First Project" assigned by Google Cloud, creating a dedicated project for each of your R deployments helps you organize resources more effectively. It's a simple process and a great habit to adopt.

1. Click on **"My First Project"**.

![](27_my_first_project.png){width=250 fig-alt="Click 'My First Project'." style="border: 1px solid black;"}

2. Click **"NEW PROJECT"**.

![](28_new_project.png){width=200 fig-alt="Click 'NEW PROJECT'." style="border: 1px solid black;"}

3. Enter the new **"Project name"**, and then click **"CREATE"**.

![](29_new_project_name.png){width=400 fig-alt="Fill the project name and click 'CREATE'." style="border: 1px solid black;"}

4. Wait a few moments for the new project to be created. Once the green checkmark appears, click **"SELECT PROJECT"** to start using your new project.

![](30_select_project.png){width=400 fig-alt="Click 'SELECT PROJECT' to use your new project." style="border: 1px solid black;"}
