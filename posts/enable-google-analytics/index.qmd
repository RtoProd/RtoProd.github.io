### Step 4: Add Google Analytics to Your Shiny App

To connect your Shiny app to Google Analytics:

1. Include the Google Analytics `gtag` code in your app's UI. To simplify this, use the pre-written R function from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jcrodriguez1989/a6a9c4168262e99ef2f9c70a110886ab){.external target="_blank"}. Copy the `use_google_analytics` function definition in your code, or directly `source` the gist:

```r
source(paste0(
  "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jcrodriguez1989/a6a9c4168262e99ef2f9c70a110886ab/raw/",
  "ea6b48e1cdaaed2839524ad700a930f6d17583d2/ga_setup.R"
))
```

2. Update your Shiny app's UI code, it should look smimilar as shown below:

```r
ui <- fluidPage(
  use_google_analytics("G-ABCD12E34F"),
  ...
```

3. Re-deploy your app to your hosting platform.

### Step 5: Test Your Installation

10. Return to the Google Analytics dashboard and click **"Test installation"**.

11. If everything is set up correctly, you'll see a success message confirming that Google Analytics is tracking your app.

### Final Step: Monitor Your Data

12. Wait a few hours for data collection to begin. Then, use the Google Analytics dashboard to explore user interactions, track app performance, and gain insights into how users engage with your app.
